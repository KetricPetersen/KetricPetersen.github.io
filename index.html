            <p>I'm currently working toward a BFA in Graphic Design and a BA in Marketing at Western Washington University.</p>
            <p>My passion lies in motion design and UX/UI—I love the challenge of problem-solving and finding creative ways to make things both beautiful <br>
                and functional. I'm always on the lookout for new techniques and fresh perspectives to push my designs further.
            <p>When I’m not buried in Figma or After Effects, you’ll probably find me on the tennis courts or deep in a crossword puzzle.</p>
                
            <p>I also like Owala water bottles, I dont think I will ever have another water bottle other than this brand. They are great because you can sip it <Br>
                through the straw or tip it over to get more water, really satisfying all your possible fassets of drinking. The color and design is also really nice.<br>
                Currently, I own 3 of these water bottles.</p>
                Always up for a good design chat!</p>
