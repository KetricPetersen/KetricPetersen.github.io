I'm currently working toward a BFA in Graphic Design and a BA in Marketing at Western Washington University. My passion lies in motion design and UX/UI—I love the challenge of problem-solving and finding creative ways to make things both beautiful and functional. I'm always on the lookout for new techniques and fresh perspectives to push my designs further.
When I’m not buried in Figma or After Effects, you’ll probably find me on the tennis courts or deep in a crossword puzzle. 
Always up for a good design chat!
I also like Owala water bottles, I dont think I will ever have another water bottle other than this brand. They are great because you can sip it through the straw or tip it over to get more water, really satisfying all your possible fassets of drinking. The color and design is also really nice. Currently, I own 3 of these water bottles.
